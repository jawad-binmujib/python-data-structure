# Linked List in Python

Welcome to my Linked List implementation in Python! This project covers the essentials of linked lists, one of the fundamental data structures. Whether you're new to programming or data structures, this will help you understand how linked lists work and how to implement them.

## What is a Linked List?
A **Linked List** is a linear collection of nodes, where each node stores:
- **Data**: The value of the node (could be any data type).
- **Next Pointer**: A reference (or address) to the next node in the sequence.

### Why Linked Lists?
- Unlike arrays, linked lists don't require a fixed size. This means you can dynamically add or remove elements without worrying about the limits of an array.
- Operations like **insertion** and **deletion** can be more efficient than arrays since you don’t have to shift elements around.

## Features of This Implementation
### Singly Linked List (The Classic Linked List)
- **Insertions** at the beginning, end, or at any specific position in the list.
- **Deletions** of nodes from the beginning, end, or specific positions.
- **Traversal** to visit and print all nodes.
- **Search** for a node by its value.

### Time Complexity of Linked List Operations
- **Insertion at the beginning**: O(1) — You can add a new node right at the front without needing to search.
- **Insertion at the end**: O(n) — You may need to traverse the entire list to reach the last node.
- **Deletion from the beginning**: O(1) — The head of the list can be easily removed.
- **Deletion from the end**: O(n) — You need to traverse to the second-to-last node to update the link.
- **Search for a node**: O(n) — You might need to check each node until you find the one you’re looking for.
